# Bridging the Gap: A Study on Access to Basic Necessities in the Philippines

<h1 style="color: #1048CB"><b>Overview</b></h1>

<p align="justify"> &emsp;
Access to necessities in the Philippines remains a challenge for many, especially the poor. While the government and other organizations have launched several initiatives to tackle these issues, insufficient funding and infrastructure remain significant obstacles. This project aims to uncover and identify which provinces must be prioritized by the governmentâ€™s poverty reduction program as well as what exactly among the four defined characterizations: access to potable water, access to toilet and sanitation, access to electricity, and access to on-premises water, such provinces need the most.
</p>

<p align="justify"> &emsp;
Using the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program from USAID in collaboration with the PSA, the proponents of the study implemented an unsupervised learning approach via clustering to uncover the top three (3) provinces that need the most help namely: Sulu, Lanao Del Sur, and Tawi-Tawi. 
</p>

<p align="justify"> &emsp;
Alternatively, the proponents also devised a poverty index that incorporates the poverty scores based on the level of need for every four characterizations (necessities) that were defined. The poverty index determined that Lanao Del Sur, Davao Occidental, and Sulu are atop the poverty ladder as defined by their level of need for basic amenities.

<h1 style="color: #1048CB"><b>Data Source</b></h1>

<p align="justify"> &emsp;
For this study, the team uses the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program from USAID in collaboration with the PSA, to share key information about people, health, and health systems (The Demographic and Health Surveys Program, n.d.). DHS Program also ensures that the basis for poverty reduction initiatives is evidenced or supported by open and transparent data, thus the continuous monitoring of poverty and health trends across various nations, setting up priorities for funding, interventions, programs, and even policymaking (The Demographic and Health Surveys Program, n.d.).
</p>

<p align="justify"> &emsp;
The DHS dataset for the Philippines contains information about 27,496 observations (Filipino households), with features that describe an entire household and all its members such as access to toilet facility (HV205), access to household appliances (e.g., radio: HV207, television: HV208, refrigerator: HV209, etc.), source of drinking and non-drinking water, housing construction materials, among others.

<h1 style="color: #1048CB"><b>Highlights</b></h1>

<p align="justify"> &emsp;
This project on Geospatial Analysis can be used by Government officials to help the poor with no access to potable water, toilet facilities, electricity, and on-premises water by:
</p>

<p align="justify"> &emsp;
1.	<strong><em>Mapping</em></strong>: Mapping the areas with the highest concentration of people without access to necessities. This mapping will help the government understand the spatial distribution of poverty.
</p>
<p align="justify"> &emsp;
2.	<strong><em>Infrastructure Planning</em></strong>: Using geospatial analysis to identify the provinces with the highest potential for infrastructure development such as power grids and water sources.
</p>
<p align="justify"> &emsp;
3.	<strong><em>Service Delivery</em></strong>: Using geospatial analysis to track the distribution of water pumps and toilets to ensure that they are being distributed equitably.
</p>
<p align="justify"> &emsp;
4.	<strong><em>Targeted Interventions</em></strong>: Using geospatial analysis to identify the most vulnerable populations within poor provinces. This will help the government prioritize areas for intervention.
</p>

<p align="justify"> &emsp;
Recommendations for the continuity of the study include the exploration of different hierarchical clustering algorithms to examine emerging patterns or if there will be different clustering assignments that would emerge from the data set. We also recommend looking at the connections between provinces on similar clusters and providing ways for the government, through geospatial inspection, to go through these provinces with the best logistics possible while incurring the least amount of cost.
